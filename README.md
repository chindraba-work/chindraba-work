# Chindraba

I'm a old-school programmer who has never stopped learning and doing. This is where I place my personal projects, with no priority to them. I also place some of my work in a companion collection on [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/Chindraba). Some of the repositories here are mirrored there, others are only found in one collection or the other.

These projects are open for collaboration, though they are intended for my own use. I prefer to use either the MIT license or the GPL 2.0 only license, though exceptions will always be a possibility. Anything you find here which is useful to your needs, please feel free to clone, fork, or otherwise copy, keeping in mind that the license given for that project still applies.

These projects are spare-time efforts, with many other work and life activities taking priority.

## My Projects

The current projects are:

- FixVid (GitHub only)
  - A collection of Bash scripts for processing movies, or video files, to make them more useful to me
- AzureGreenImporter (GitHub only)
  - Scripts, in Bash and MySQL, to process the inventory files from AzureGreen and covert them to database values for use in a ZenCart store
- Optioniser (GitHub only)
  - A preprocessor to handle command-line argument options in a highly flexible manner

   - A collection of scripts to handle PGP keys in a bulk fashion

   - My efforts at solving the problems for Advent of Code, 2019
 - repo-filler (GitHub and GitLab)
   - A set of files and scripts for pre-populating a new repo with the files I prefer, in the way I want them
 - assorted-tools (GitLab only)
   - A general catch-all collection of scripts I have built for various needs and wish to keep handy for quite a while
